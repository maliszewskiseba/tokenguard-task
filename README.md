Task for TokenGuard

First of all I tried to deal with errors but TS compiler did not want to cooperate (useUnknownInCatchVariables ts rule didnt work)
I applied some kind of fake async fetch timeout and loader when it is loading.
I made this app with Nextjs and direction routing.
I used tailiwnd to style, made bunch of generic components for reuse
I made couple helper functions to deal with data management
At beggining I was thinking about use redux (you can find chunks of redux code), but it was overkill for the time which i had.

Because of my life situations (I know it's not an excause), I was limited with time and mentality, to do this task. I think I could do this better.
